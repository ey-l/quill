Imagine you have an array of numeric values, and you want to discretize it. Given your understanding of the semantic meaning of the candidate binning in your answer to the first question, your task is to measure the distance between a gold-standard binning and a candidate binning, specifically on a semantic scale.  

**Semantic surprising score**: a score within the range of 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 represents not surprising at all and 1.0 represents extremely surprising.  
**Semantic gold-standard binning**: the gold-standard binning that has a semantic surprising score of 0.0.
**Data context**: explains the domain of the numeric data that you try to discretize. 

You should first understand and analyze the data context and semantic gold-standard binning. Then, given your interpretation of the context and gold standard, use your knowledge of the domain and common sense, and then give a semantic surprising score for the candidate binning. Note that the gold-standard binning may not be the only binning that makes perfect semantic sense. Incorporate your own knowledge about the domain to make a more accurate judgement. Give a score, no explanation.

## Example:
#### INPUT
Data context: human BMI 
Semantic gold-standard binning: [0, 18.5, 25, 30, inf]
Candidate binning: [0, 18.5, 25, 30, inf]

#### OUTPUT
0.0
